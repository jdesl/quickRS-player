//! Take analysis (new in quickRS, P18.3, D30): a recording of the guitar over a stretch of the chart, checked note
//! by note against the chart, with what was played instead ("your tab"), bar by bar results, the timing tendency and
//! the few problems most worth working on, in words. No AI: score-informed signal analysis.
//!
//! How it works:
//! 1. Plucks are found in the whole take (onsets.rs: spectral flux, timed by the energy rise).
//! 2. Every chart event in the stretch (a note, double stop or chord, merged as the scorer merges them) gets the
//!    plucks within EARLY / LATE of where it falls in the take (`TakeTiming`, wall-clock windows whatever the
//!    speed) as candidates, each checked with the scorer's own test (detect.rs `group_matches`: the expected
//!    pitches present and louder than before, no strong foreign peaks); a chord is also tried a little later
//!    (a slow strum).
//! 3. Events and plucks are aligned in order (each pluck plays at most one event): a right pluck is worth much
//!    more than a wrong one, both a little less the further off time. A first pass gives the take's overall
//!    offset; the second pass centres the windows on it (a take recorded 80 ms late still lines up), while the
//!    offsets reported stay the raw ones.
//! 4. A matched pluck that isn't right is transcribed: one expected note by the McLeod pitch method (a harmonic
//!    product spectrum guess below clarity 0.8), two or more by the strongest harmonic series in the spectrum
//!    (`pitches`), compared note by note with the chord. An event with no pluck is looked for in the sound at its
//!    time (a hammer-on or pull-off makes no pluck; a soft pick may not either); not there, it's missed (a
//!    legato note or a pinch harmonic we can't hear clearly is "not checked", never called wrong).
//! 5. Bends: the pitch is followed through the note; short of the target by more than half a semitone is wrong,
//!    untrackable is a note "bend not checked". Slides are checked where they start.
//! 6. Plucks left over are extra notes (not the second half of a strum, not a bend's wobble), with their pitch.
//! 7. Every pitch heard gets a string and fret: the chart note's string when the pitch is on it, else the
//!    position nearest the hand (the chart's frets around it).
//!
//! Timing offsets are in wall-clock milliseconds (what the player feels; at half speed a 40 ms late note is 20 ms
//! of chart time), positive = late. Accuracy = right / (right + wrong + missed); "not checked" doesn't count.
